The CDL is based on studies and guidelines for the clinical population and is used for clinical decision making. The CDL can change because of how they are based."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the difference between sensitivity in tests and specificity?", "Sensitivity is the ability to identify patients without the disease and specificity is the ability to identify patients with the disease", "High sensitivity is good for identifying a diagnosis, while high specificity is good for ruling out a diagnosis", "Sensitivity is the percentage of unaffected individuals who have a negative test result, specificity is the percentage of affected individuals who have a positive test result", "Sensitivity is measured by how often a test picks up a disease, while specificity is measured by how good a test is at ignoring those without the disease", 4, "Sensitivity is calculated based on how well a test picks up a disease, and specificity is calculated based on how specific it is only to individuals who are truly affected."));
bank3h03.push(new question("In a population that is given a test for disease, 6 return a true negative, 1 returns a false negative, 1 returns a true positive, and 2 return a false positive.

bank3h03.push(new question("How much body water is stored in the intracellular compartment?", "1/3", "3/4", "1/4", "2/3", 4, "The intracellular compartment (ICF) contains around 2/3 of body water. The remaining 1/3 is in the ECF, with plasma holding 1/4 of it and interstitial fluid holding the other 3/4."));
bank3h03.push(new question("Which is the major extracellular cation?", "Potassium", "Sodium", "Lithium", "Hydronium", 2, "Sodium is the major extracellular cation. Potassium is the major intracellular cation."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What does it mean when the intracellular and extracellular fluids are isotonic?", "They have different osmolalities", "They have equal amounts of water", "They have the same osmolalities", "They have equal amounts of sodium", 3, "Isotonic means that the ICF and ECF have the same osmotic concentrations, or osmolalities, primarily determined by sodium concentration."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the pathway of aldosterone production in the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS)?", "Prorenin --> Renin --> Angiotensin I --> Angiotensin II --> Aldosterone", "Angiotensin I --> Angiotensin II --> Prorenin --> Renin --> Aldosterone", "Prorenin --> Renin --> Angiotensin II --> Angiotensin I --> Aldosterone", "Angiotensin II --> Angiotensin I --> Prorenin --> Renin --> Aldosterone", 1, "The pathway of aldosterone production is: Prorenin --> (Cleaved) --> Renin --> (Released in blood, cleaves Angiotensinogen) --> Angiotensin I --> (Converted) --> Angiotensin II --> (Stimulates release from adrenal cortex) --> Aldosterone."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is another name for ADH?", "Aldosterone", "Vasopressin", "Renin", "Angiotensin I", 2, "Another name for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is vasopressin."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the purpose of Aldosterone?", "To promote water retention", "To promote potassium retention", "To promote sodium loss", "To increase ECF volume", 4, "Aldosterone helps increase ECF volume by promoting sodium retention in the kidneys, which draws water into the ECF."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the purpose of Vasopressin (ADH)?", "To promote sodium retention", "To increase ECF osmolality", "To promote water retention", "To decrease ECF volume", 3, "ADH promotes water reabsorption in the kindneys when the ECF osmolality is elevated and ECF volume is lowered."));
bank3h03.push(new question("When might ADH and Aldosterone be released together?", "Low blood pressure", "High salt intake", "High water intake", "Dilute urine", 1, "Low blood pressure can cause both ADH and Aldosterone to be released together. It decreases ECF volume, which releases ADH, and the decreased ECF volume also triggers the RAAS pathway, which releases Aldosterone."));
bank3h03.push(new question("When might ADH be released but not Aldosterone?", "Low blood pressure", "High salt intake", "High water intake", "Dilute urine", 2, "High salt intake without enough water can release ADH due to increased ECF osmolality, but not Aldosterone because the abundance of salt in the ECF draws water into the ECF and increases volume, which suppresses the RAAS pathway."));

(Pick option 1 for now, Hyperglycemia is also Pseudohyponatremia according to the slides but not according to the internet)", "Hyperlipidemia", "Hyperglycemia", "Dilutional Hyponatremia", "All of the above are cause of Pseudohyponatremia", 1, "Hyperlipidemia causes Pseudohyponatremia by lowering the water fraction in serum, resulting in indirect (diluted) measurements showing lower sodium concentration. Hyperglycemia and Dilutional Hyponatremia decrease sodium concentration by adding water into the ECF (High Glucose --> ICF water to ECF --> Low Na+, Excess ECF water --> Low Na+, respectively)."));
