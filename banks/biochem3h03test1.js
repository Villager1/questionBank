bank3h03.push(new question("What is the difference between serum and plasma?", "Serum lacks clotting factors that plasma has", "Serum is the aqueous phase of blood, while plasma is coagulated blood", "Serum has white blood cells and platelets which can provide more information about the blood", "There is no difference between serum and plasma", 1, "Serum and plasma are both from the aqueous phase of blood, but unlike serum, plasma still has coagulation factors despite not clotting. Plasma is preserved by anticoagulants."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the difference between the Reference Interval (RI) and the Clinical Decision Limit (CDL)?", "The RI is arbitrary while the CDL is based on population statistics", "The RI is used for clinical decision making while the CDL is used for identifying deviations from the average in the general population", "The RI is based on the general population and the CDL is based on the clinical population", "The RI is based on clinical studies and guidelines while the CDL is the 95% central interval of the reference distribution", 3, "The RI is based on the general population, and is based on the 95% central interval of the reference distribution. The CDL is based on studies and guidelines for the clinical population and is used for clinical decision making. The CDL can change because of how they are based."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the difference between sensitivity in tests and specificity?", "Sensitivity is the ability to identify patients without the disease and specificity is the ability to identify patients with the disease", "High sensitivity is good for identifying a diagnosis, while high specificity is good for ruling out a diagnosis", "Sensitivity is the percentage of unaffected individuals who have a negative test result, specificity is the percentage of affected individuals who have a positive test result", "Sensitivity is measured by how often a positive test picks up a disease, while specificity is measured by how good a test is at isolating a disease", 4, "Sensitivity is calculated based on how well a test picks up a disease, and specificity is calculated based on how specific it is only to individuals who are truly affected."));
bank3h03.push(new question("In a population that is given a test for disease, 6 return a true negative, 1 returns a false negative, 1 returns a true positive, and 2 return a false positive. What is the sensitivity and specificity of the test?", "Sensitivity: 0.5, Specificity: 0.75", "Sensitivity: 50, Specificity: 75", "Sensitivity: 33.3, Specificity: 85.7", "Sensitivity: 0.333, Specificity: 0.857", 2, "Sensitivity is calculated by the amount of individuals with a true positive divided by the amount of affected individuals, times 100 (TP/(TP+FN) * 100), and specificity is calculated by the amount of individuals with a true negative divided by the amount of unaffected individuals, times 100 (TN/(TN+FP) * 100)."));

bank3h03.push(new question("How much body water is stored in the intracellular compartment?", "1/3", "3/4", "1/4", "2/3", 4, "The intracellular compartment (ICF) contains around 2/3 of body water. The remaining 1/3 is in the ECF, with plasma holding 1/4 of it and interstitial fluid holding the other 3/4."));
bank3h03.push(new question("Which is the major extracellular cation?", "Potassium", "Sodium", "Lithium", "Hydronium", 2, "Sodium is the major extracellular cation. Potassium is the major intracellular cation."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What does it mean when the intracellular and extracellular fluids are isotonic?", "They have different osmolalities", "They have equal amounts of water", "They have the same osmolalities", "They have equal amounts of sodium", 3, "Isotonic means that the ICF and ECF have the same osmotic concentrations, or osmolalities, primarily determined by sodium concentration."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the pathway of aldosterone production in the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS)?", "Prorenin --> Renin --> Angiotensin I --> Angiotensin II --> Aldosterone", "Angiotensin I --> Angiotensin II --> Prorenin --> Renin --> Aldosterone", "Prorenin --> Renin --> Angiotensin II --> Angiotensin I --> Aldosterone", "Angiotensin II --> Angiotensin I --> Prorenin --> Renin --> Aldosterone", 1, "The pathway of aldosterone production is: Prorenin --> (Cleaved) --> Renin --> (Released in blood, cleaves Angiotensinogen) --> Angiotensin I --> (Converted) --> Angiotensin II --> (Stimulates release from adrenal cortex) --> Aldosterone."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is another name for ADH?", "Aldosterone", "Vasopressin", "Renin", "Angiotensin I", 2, "Another name for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is vasopressin."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the purpose of Aldosterone?", "To promote water retention", "To promote potassium retention", "To promote sodium loss", "To increase ECF volume", 4, "Aldosterone helps increase ECF volume by promoting sodium retention in the kidneys, which draws water into the ECF."));
bank3h03.push(new question("What is the purpose of Vasopressin (ADH)?", "To promote sodium retention", "To increase ECF osmolality", "To promote water retention", "To decrease ECF volume", 1, "ADH promotes water reabsorption in the kindneys when the ECF osmolality is elevated and ECF volume is lowered."));
bank3h03.push(new question("When might ADH and Aldosterone be released together?", "Low blood pressure", "High salt intake", "High water intake", "Dilute urine", 1, "Low blood pressure can cause both ADH and Aldosterone to be released together. It decreases ECF volume, which releases ADH, and the decreased ECF volume also triggers the RAAS pathway, which releases Aldosterone."));
bank3h03.push(new question("When might ADH be released but not Aldosterone?", "Low blood pressure", "High salt intake", "High water intake", "Dilute urine", 2, "High salt intake without enough water can release ADH due to increased ECF osmolality, but not Aldosterone because the abundance of salt in the ECF draws water into the ECF and increases volume, which suppresses the RAAS pathway."));
